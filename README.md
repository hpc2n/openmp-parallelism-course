OpenMP-based parallelism in scientific computing
==============================================

**Abstract:** The purpose of the course is to learn how one can parallelize a serial code using OpenMP.

**Content:** The course mainly focuses on the task-pragmas implemented in the newer incarnations of OpenMP. 

**Format:** The course will be three half-days and comprised of lectures and hands-on sessions. This is an online-only course (Zoom).

**Audience:** UMU course.
